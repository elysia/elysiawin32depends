/** ThreadSafeQueueWithNotification is a ThreadSafeQueue that also allows the
 *  user to specify a notification callback which is invoked when an item is
 *  pushed on the queue, causing it to go from empty to non-empty (note that a
 *  notification is not (necessarily) generated for every single push).  This
 *  mechanism allows the "receiving" thread to "wait" on this queue efficiently,
 *  aggregating handling of elements if more are inserted before the
 *  notification is handled.  This also allows a single receiving thread to
 *  "wait" on multiple ThreadSafeQueues.
 *
 *  Note that notifications are generated from the thread or strand in which the
 *  push occurs.  If you want to receive them in another thread, you probably
 *  want to use a callback wrapped by a strand or which performs a post to an
 *  IOService, depending on your setup.
 *
 *  Finally, note that the notification mechanism is conservative: it is
 *  possible that, due to concurrent pushing and popping, it is possible an
 *  extra notification will be generated, resulting in a notification callback
 *  being invoked when nothing remains in the queue.  Therefore the user should
 *  not assume the queue is non-empty when a notification callback is invoked.
