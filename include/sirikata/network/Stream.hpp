/** Stream interface for network connections.
 *
 *  Streams are lightweight communication primitives, backed by a shared connection.
 *  An individual stream is a reliable, ordered stream of arbitrarily sized messages.
 *  The stream only returns full messages to the user.
 *
 *  Streams can be created or cloned efficiently and can start accepting data without
 *  having to first go through a connection procedure. When substreams are created by
 *  the remote endpoint, the user is notified via a callback.  Data can be sent from
 *  any thread.  Data is received via a callback, but the user can pause callbacks if
 *  they cannot handle the rate of callbacks provided by the Stream.
 *
 *  Note that substreams may outlast their parent streams.  In this case, further substream
 *  callbacks are dispatched to the original callback.
